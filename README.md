# muriqi-kitchens-app

The goal of this app is to achieve a logging app that: 
  1. Allows the user to input orders of cabinets 
  2. Allows the user to see all pass orders filled out 
  3. Determines how much having the order built and delivered costs
  4. Determines how much it will cost the company if they had the cabinets built in the shop
  5. Track the average cost of building cabinets per month
  
Stretch Goals: 
  1. The app has an algorithm that determines the most cost-efficient method of ordering cabinets built and building them manually
